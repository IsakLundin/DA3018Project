## 23/5-21
- Created Repository
- Added a file for testing with 1000 first lines of the original data by using
$ head -1000 filename > ProjectTestFile

## 24/5-21
Had help from TA about the project and got some questions answered.
- I should remove the line if either the first or the second config is overlapping entirely.
- I have to convert the vertex string into integer, perhaps with hashing (Need to look into this more). 
- Either create a Hash Table or maybe a graph with Arraylist with the vertex and neighbors as values.
- I will definitely need more help with how to get the test data working with code.

### Answer about the assignment
- Node degree distribution: This means how many neighbors every node has.
- Numnber of components: This means how many disconnected graphs there are.
- Component size distribution: This means how many of these disconnected graphs has x amount of nodes.
